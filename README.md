# Number-System-Converter
A Python-based beginner level tool that converts numbers between different number systems such as binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal.
The Number System Converter is a Python-based command-line application that enables users to convert numbers between multiple number systems, including binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal.

This project is designed to demonstrate a strong understanding of number system concepts and algorithmic logic by implementing all conversions manually without relying on built-in Python functions. The program uses a menu-driven interface that allows users to select different types of conversions and interact with the system in a simple and intuitive way.

The application supports both direct and indirect conversions, such as binary to decimal, decimal to hexadecimal, and even grouped conversions like binary to octal and binary to hexadecimal using bit manipulation techniques. Each conversion is performed step-by-step using mathematical operations such as division, modulus, and positional value calculation.

Additionally, the project focuses on fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements, string manipulation, and user input handling. It serves as a strong foundational project for beginners to understand how number systems work internally and how they can be implemented programmatically.

Overall, this project highlights problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and the ability to build a complete working application using Python.
